# Important!: These terms should be listed in an order of decreasing complexity so that terms that may be contained in
# other terms are not replaced first, e.g., if "Aliens" is listed first, "Illegal Aliens" will get overrode to
# read "Illegal Noncitizens".
# Also, use lower case only in the key to support efficient case-insensitive matching.
